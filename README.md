# Sales Data Processing Application

Sales Data Processing Application is a simple Java application created for testing purposes.

## Purpose
This project is a pure Java application developed to perform data processing and demonstrate understanding of object-oriented programming principles, clean code, and automated testing. It was created as part of an assignment to show the ability to design and implement a maintainable and testable Java program.

The main goals of this application are:
- Implement a structured and maintainable Java codebase
- Apply OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Handle data input and output properly
- Provide automated tests to verify functionality
- Meet the requirements defined in the assignment

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17** (or higher)
- **Maven** – for build and dependency management
- **JUnit 5** – for testing

---

## Requirements
Before running the application, make sure you have:
- Java 17 or later installed (`java -version`)
- Maven installed (`mvn -version`)

---

## Installation and Running the Application
Use the standard Maven build process:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Usage
You can use standard Maven commands, for example:
```
